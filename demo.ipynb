From domains, phones, emails, business entity maintenance, business licenses, mail received on their behalf, etc. It's complex and we service millions of users.\\nThe largest problem you'll be trying to solve is running our Phone App. We run a second phone line app mostly for businesses but we fancy ourselves as the most private, encrypted way to send messages and do phone calls that exists. Think Whats App and Google Voice, but without it being free so the big evil corporations can get your meta data. Running a second phone line and keeping our users communications as private as possible on hardware that is meant to not provide any privacy to the user on infrastructure and telecommunications that are meant to not provide any privacy to the users is our largest challenge. But it's a war we firmly believe in.\\nBut our apps today are embarrassing and shows our lack of focus on mobile... We're ready for a change. It's been hard to service so many clients at our pace of growth and put the focus on mobile that we wish we would have done a decade ago. With our organization structure, size, and resources we have today, we're ready, even if it's a decade late.\\nIf you're up for a challenge, working with fun good humans, and into doing good work. We'd love to talk\\nLocation:\\nRemote | Spokane - Austin - SLC |\\nDuration:\\nFull Time\\nWage:\\n$120,000/year\\nResponsibilities:\\n• Develop exciting new mobile applications for iOS from the ground up\\n• Collaborate with software developers to integrate existing technologies (APIs) into a mobile application\\n\\nMinimum Qualifications:\\n• BS in Computer Science or four years of related experience\\n• 1+ years experience with designing, building, and maintaining complex mobile apps on iOS\\n• Experience working with iOS frameworks such as Core Data, Core Animation, Core Graphics and Core Text\\n• Comfortable using GIT for version control - along with a decent level of GIT hygiene\\n• You're pleasant person to work with\\n\\nPreferred Qualifications:\\n• Familiarity with Product organized companies and Product development lifecycles\\n• Able to work in an agile environment with a focus on continuous integration\\n• You are based in the United States (or similar time zone)\\n\\nWhy you might like this job:\\nYou hope the metaverse doesn't come... but if it does, we'll at least have caught up to the best mobile app experience we could have had before we all scratch our heads and wonder what on earth we're supposed to make now to stay relevant.\\nOn a more serious note though. We're into open source and privacy. Fighting invasive massive corporations following and tracking users should be a passion borderline problem you deal with anxiety over. We as a company have no affiliates, never sold one ounce of data and go to great lengths to not leak it out the side door via third party tools. If you're passionate about protecting users as the world gets less and less private even though they do dumb stuff like give a cookie pop up on a screen that doesn't do anything or tell us they're ditching cookies and it's for privacy even though it's just a play to not let meta data get into other big evil corporations hands... If this stuff resonates with you.

By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more.\\n\\nThe Role\\n\\nPalantir's defense product vertical builds mission-critical products for the modern warfighter. We provide a complete ecosystem where customers can securely integrate and visualize their data, and build sophisticated, full-fledged programs such as common operating pictures, alert-triaging inboxes, and resource allocation planning tools driven by rich-ML models. Our customers use our defense offering to perform rich analyses that drive core operations within their organizations - these programs are relied upon for daily operations in the command centers and battlefronts of militaries across the world.\\n\\nThis is a frontend engineering role focused on application development for our defense product offering, where you will be responsible for crafting the applications that organizations use every day to keep their countries safe. You will be architecting and developing interfaces to make sophisticated, data-intensive workflows both powerful and approachable, including to non-technical users. You may spend one day talking to users to better understand their needs and identifying product gaps to improve. The next day, you might find yourself putting that customer context to use and brainstorming how to handle intricate UX needs with your teammates. You’ll regularly face sophisticated technical problems, requiring you to scope out the solution design and finding an incremental path to shipping the new features. As part of this, you will own APIs and schemas that power your frontend code, and work with backend engineers in developing them together. You’ll be constantly exploring new horizons and building new skills in service of real world needs: between type theory, operational transforms, 2D and 3D mapping, UI design systems, high-scale graphics rendering, evidence-based performance optimization, and the never-ending need to decompose user asks into rich, sophisticated, and maintainable software, there is always a new challenge to be faced.\\n\\nCore Responsibilities\\n\\nAs a frontend engineer working on our defense product offering, you will be involved throughout the product lifecycle - from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution and shipping.\\n\\nSome examples of product work you could work on are:\\n• Build for high-scale, collaborative, geospatial workflows (Gaia)\\n• Design sophisticated frameworks to enable complex workflows across applications in a single workspace\\n• Develop the next generation of real-time collaborative tooling and data-analysis solutions (Secure Collaboration)\\n\\nTechnologies We Use\\n• Typescript and React are central to our frontend development.\\n• Blueprint as a re-usable frontend component library.\\n• A combination of open-source and internal technologies that suit the problems at hand.\\n• Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, GitHub, and CircleCI.\\n\\nWhat We Value\\n• Passion for building user interfaces that enable users to tackle their problems.\\n• Ability to work optimally in teams of technical and non-technical individuals, e.g. brainstorming and iterating with product designers\\n• Skill and comfort working in a constantly evolving environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users.\\n• Experience building high-quality software in a fast-paced CI/CD development environment\\n• Proven ability to learn continuously, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision.\\n• Ability to learn new technology and concepts, even without in-depth experience. Motivated by unlocking or improving user workflows while still maintaining engineering quality.\\n\\nWhat We Require\\n• 2+ years of frontend software engineering experience.\\n• Strong frontend coding skills. Regardless of which frameworks you use or how you learned them, we’re looking for people who can write clean, effective code. You should already have proficiency in JavaScript and an understanding of how web technologies work.\\n• Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or related field, or equivalent understanding of algorithms, performance, and systems design.\\n• Strong written and verbal communication skills.\\n• Eligibility and willingness to obtain a US Security clearance.\\n\\nSalary\\n\\nThe estimated salary range for this position is estimated to be $135,000 - $200,000/year.

Our community includes major systems like the Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, Cleveland Clinic, and Kaiser Permanente, as well as leading academic medical centers at the University of Wisconsin, University of Michigan, University of California, University of Texas, The Ohio State University, and many more.\\n\\nExperience our state-of-the-art campus, eat delicious food, and travel the world.\\n\\nWe don’t believe in cubicles. (Well, we believe they exist, but…) Our uniquely themed campus was designed to heighten your ability to get stuff done in your office, a conference room, or by the fireplace in a comfy chair. For lunch, visit King’s Cross or Cassiopeia for a wide array of meal options, or go to one of our smaller, themed bistros, featuring wood-rotisserie, pan-Asian, and Latin-inspired cuisine. All meals are restaurant-quality but cost only a few dollars, and they’re prepared by a team comprised of kitchen talent from restaurants around the country. And, after five years here, you’ll earn a four-week sabbatical anywhere in the world. Staff have kayaked in Patagonia, attended a Beyoncé concert in Ireland, built a library in Tanzania, and run a marathon in Antarctica.\\n\\nLive affordably in a city known for its rising tech talent.\\n\\nEpic is located just outside Madison, Wisconsin, which is the second fastest growing market for tech talent in the United States, home to the state capital, and the University of Wisconsin. Madison has received accolades for being the greenest city in America (NerdWallet), the best city for renters (SmartAsset), fittest city in America (Fitbit), and, for the gamers, is one of a handful of US cities to have a Killer Queen arcade game, located at Madison’s first arcade bar.\\n\\nMore than just important work.\\n\\nWe offer comprehensive benefits to keep you healthy and happy as you grow in your life and career, and your merit-based compensation will reflect the impact your work has on the company and our customers. You'll also be eligible for annual raises and bonuses, as well as stock grants, which give you an even greater stake in the success of Epic and our customers. Healthcare is global, and building the best ideas from around the world into Epic software is a point of pride.

and Angular into the ExamDeveloper web app. This role is expected to evolve in two parts. During this initial build-out period which we anticipate will last 1 year, you’ll direct the work of the 3-person USA-based team of developers, QA consultants in India, and additional temporary Dev and QA consultants. Roughly 2/3rds of your time will be writing code as an individual contributor and the other 1/3rd of your time will be on leadership and supervision tasks. You will supervise all engineering activities of the team, including technical decision-making, creating team processes, and leading code review. You will provide work direction as part of Agile software development processes and serve as the team’s Scrum Master. Though you will supervise the work of other engineers on the team, this is an individual contributor role and HR management responsibilities of other engineers would be with someone else.\\n\\nAfter this initial build-out period is complete, your role shifts to be 100% individual contributor at a Senior level and your focus areas will expand beyond just Item Assist. You’ll continue to provide technical leadership to the team but covering all of ExamDeveloper, not just the Item Assist features. You’ll be part of a larger team at this stage.\\n\\nThe Tool\\n\\nOur Item Assist tool started off as a standalone prototype tool for letting users use generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) to create test questions. Building upon the success of the prototype we are incorporating these AI interactions into Pearson VUE’s ExamDeveloper item authoring tool (https://www.pearsonvue.com/us/en/test-owners/develop.html). ExamDeveloper is a web-based exam development platform that allows our customers to write, review and manage questions on their exams. ExamDeveloper is the leading web-based tool for creating tests to certify test-takers in the professional skills they require. Customers rely on ExamDeveloper to support their entire workflow around question writing, collaborative review, scoring, and test management.\\n\\nSpecial note: this role and this specific team will not be doing AI-based development work. Other engineering teams at Pearson are working on the AI capabilities that power the Item Assist product. The Item Assist features in ExamDeveloper represent the user interface and the application experience for our customers. Therefore, skills like machine learning, prompting, large language models, etc are not applicable to this role, but some knowledge about AI concepts could be beneficial.\\n\\nIn this role you’ll focus on the new Item Assist features in ExamDeveloper but will also work on other ExamDeveloper development efforts. You will partner with the Product Manager to bring their vision to reality and work alongside the Architect, Project Manager, and Business Analyst.\\n\\nExamDeveloper’s primary tech stack is .NET and C# on the backend and Angular on the frontend hosted in Microsoft Azure. Item Assist will use an in-house Angular-based UI framework. You’ll work with containerized services orchestrated by Kubernetes and Microsoft SQL Server. We strongly prefer Angular experience because it is an important technology for this product.\\n\\nWork Location:\\n\\nREMOTE - United States , required to work mostly Central time zone normal business hours.\\n\\nResponsibilities\\n• Develop new features and other technical implementation work (see notes above for allocations for this that vary over time)\\n• Make technical decisions on behalf of the team with partnership of the Architect\\n• Provide leadership for the team of engineers in an Agile software development approach\\n• Create work processes for the team and continually evolve them as needs change\\n• Enforce high standards of software development to achieve quality\\n• Coach other team members to help them grow and bring out their best work\\n• Plan the team’s work and estimate future desired work\\n• Act as Scrum Master of the Agile team\\n• Release and On-call duties -- Participate in release deployment activities and a rotating on-call escalation system during non-business hours.\\n\\nRequired Education And Experience\\n• 5+ years work experience as a software developer\\n• Experience supervising the work of technical staff either formally or informally\\n• 2+ years experience with Angular\\n• 2+ years experience with C#\\n• Bachelor degree in Computer Science, MIS, or equivalent technology discipline\\n\\nDesired Knowledge, Skills, And Abilities\\n• Relational databases\\n• DevOps workflows related to cloud-based development and deployment\\n• Experience in an Agile software development environment\\n• Demonstrated technical leadership\\n• Clear communication skills to various types of audiences\\n• History of continuous improvement\\n\\nCompensation at Pearson is influenced by a wide array of factors including but not limited to skill set, level of experience, and specific location. As required by the Colorado, California, Washington State, New York State and New York City laws, the pay range for this position is as follows:\\n\\nThe minimum full-time salary range is between $120k- 135k.\\n\\nThis position is eligible to participate in an annual incentive program, and information on benefits offered is here.\\n\\nWhat To Expect From Pearson\\n\\nDid you know Pearson is one of the 10 most innovative education companies of 2022?\\n\\nAt Pearson, we add life to a lifetime of learning so everyone can realize the life they imagine.

'job_description': 'Summary\\n\\nAs a Senior Software Developer, you will be the most senior engineer of a 3-person dev team focused on adding new “Item Assist” features using C# and Angular into the ExamDeveloper web app. This role is expected to evolve in two parts. During this initial build-out period which we anticipate will last 1 year, you’ll direct the work of the 3-person USA-based team of developers, QA consultants in India, and additional temporary Dev and QA consultants. Roughly 2/3rds of your time will be writing code as an individual contributor and the other 1/3rd of your time will be on leadership and supervision tasks. You will supervise all engineering activities of the team, including technical decision-making, creating team processes, and leading code review. You will provide work direction as part of Agile software development processes and serve as the team’s Scrum Master. Though you will supervise the work of other engineers on the team, this is an individual contributor role and HR management responsibilities of other engineers would be with someone else.\\n\\nAfter this initial build-out period is complete, your role shifts to be 100% individual contributor at a Senior level and your focus areas will expand beyond just Item Assist. You’ll continue to provide technical leadership to the team but covering all of ExamDeveloper, not just the Item Assist features. You’ll be part of a larger team at this stage.\\n\\nThe Tool\\n\\nOur Item Assist tool started off as a standalone prototype tool for letting users use generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) to create test questions. Building upon the success of the prototype we are incorporating these AI interactions into Pearson VUE’s ExamDeveloper item authoring tool (https://www.pearsonvue.com/us/en/test-owners/develop.html). ExamDeveloper is a web-based exam development platform that allows our customers to write, review and manage questions on their exams. ExamDeveloper is the leading web-based tool for creating tests to certify test-takers in the professional skills they require. Customers rely on ExamDeveloper to support their entire workflow around question writing, collaborative review, scoring, and test management.\\n\\nSpecial note: this role and this specific team will not be doing AI-based development work. Other engineering teams at Pearson are working on the AI capabilities that power the Item Assist product. The Item Assist features in ExamDeveloper represent the user interface and the application experience for our customers. Therefore, skills like machine learning, prompting, large language models, etc are not applicable to this role, but some knowledge about AI concepts could be beneficial.\\n\\nIn this role you’ll focus on the new Item Assist features in ExamDeveloper but will also work on other ExamDeveloper development efforts. You will partner with the Product Manager to bring their vision to reality and work alongside the Architect, Project Manager, and Business Analyst.\\n\\nExamDeveloper’s primary tech stack is .NET and C# on the backend and Angular on the frontend hosted in Microsoft Azure. Item Assist will use an in-house Angular-based UI framework. You’ll work with containerized services orchestrated by Kubernetes and Microsoft SQL Server. We strongly prefer Angular experience because it is an important technology for this product.\\n\\nWork Location:\\n\\nREMOTE - United States , required to work mostly Central time zone normal business hours.\\n\\nResponsibilities\\n• Develop new features and other technical implementation work (see notes above for allocations for this that vary over time)\\n• Make technical decisions on behalf of the team with partnership of the Architect\\n• Provide leadership for the team of engineers in an Agile software development approach\\n• Create work processes for the team and continually evolve them as needs change\\n• Enforce high standards of software development to achieve quality\\n• Coach other team members to help them grow and bring out their best work\\n• Plan the team’s work and estimate future desired work\\n• Act as Scrum Master of the Agile team\\n• Release and On-call duties -- Participate in release deployment activities and a rotating on-call escalation system during non-business hours.\\n\\nRequired Education And Experience\\n• 5+ years work experience as a software developer\\n• Experience supervising the work of technical staff either formally or informally\\n• 2+ years experience with Angular\\n• 2+ years experience with C#\\n• Bachelor degree in Computer Science, MIS, or equivalent technology discipline\\n\\nDesired Knowledge, Skills, And Abilities\\n• Relational databases\\n• DevOps workflows related to cloud-based development and deployment\\n• Experience in an Agile software development environment\\n• Demonstrated technical leadership\\n• Clear communication skills to various types of audiences\\n• History of continuous improvement\\n\\nCompensation at Pearson is influenced by a wide array of factors including but not limited to skill set, level of experience, and specific location. As required by the Colorado, California, Washington State, New York State and New York City laws, the pay range for this position is as follows:\\n\\nThe minimum full-time salary range is between $120k- 135k.\\n\\nThis position is eligible to participate in an annual incentive program, and information on benefits offered is here.\\n\\nWhat To Expect From Pearson\\n\\nDid you know Pearson is one of the 10 most innovative education companies of 2022?\\n\\nAt Pearson, we add life to a lifetime of learning so everyone can realize the life they imagine.

During this initial build-out period which we anticipate will last 1 year, you’ll direct the work of the 3-person USA-based team of developers, QA consultants in India, and additional temporary Dev and QA consultants. Roughly 2/3rds of your time will be writing code as an individual contributor and the other 1/3rd of your time will be on leadership and supervision tasks. You will supervise all engineering activities of the team, including technical decision-making, creating team processes, and leading code review. You will provide work direction as part of Agile software development processes and serve as the team’s Scrum Master. Though you will supervise the work of other engineers on the team, this is an individual contributor role and HR management responsibilities of other engineers would be with someone else.\\n\\nAfter this initial build-out period is complete, your role shifts to be 100% individual contributor at a Senior level and your focus areas will expand beyond just Item Assist. You’ll continue to provide technical leadership to the team but covering all of ExamDeveloper, not just the Item Assist features. You’ll be part of a larger team at this stage.\\n\\nThe Tool\\n\\nOur Item Assist tool started off as a standalone prototype tool for letting users use generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) to create test questions. Building upon the success of the prototype we are incorporating these AI interactions into Pearson VUE’s ExamDeveloper item authoring tool (https://www.pearsonvue.com/us/en/test-owners/develop.html). ExamDeveloper is a web-based exam development platform that allows our customers to write, review and manage questions on their exams. ExamDeveloper is the leading web-based tool for creating tests to certify test-takers in the professional skills they require. Customers rely on ExamDeveloper to support their entire workflow around question writing, collaborative review, scoring, and test management.\\n\\nSpecial note: this role and this specific team will not be doing AI-based development work. Other engineering teams at Pearson are working on the AI capabilities that power the Item Assist product. The Item Assist features in ExamDeveloper represent the user interface and the application experience for our customers. Therefore, skills like machine learning, prompting, large language models, etc are not applicable to this role, but some knowledge about AI concepts could be beneficial.\\n\\nIn this role you’ll focus on the new Item Assist features in ExamDeveloper but will also work on other ExamDeveloper development efforts. You will partner with the Product Manager to bring their vision to reality and work alongside the Architect, Project Manager, and Business Analyst.\\n\\nExamDeveloper’s primary tech stack is .NET and C# on the backend and Angular on the frontend hosted in Microsoft Azure. Item Assist will use an in-house Angular-based UI framework. You’ll work with containerized services orchestrated by Kubernetes and Microsoft SQL Server. We strongly prefer Angular experience because it is an important technology for this product.\\n\\nWork Location:\\n\\nREMOTE - United States , required to work mostly Central time zone normal business hours.\\n\\nResponsibilities\\n• Develop new features and other technical implementation work (see notes above for allocations for this that vary over time)\\n• Make technical decisions on behalf of the team with partnership of the Architect\\n• Provide leadership for the team of engineers in an Agile software development approach\\n• Create work processes for the team and continually evolve them as needs change\\n• Enforce high standards of software development to achieve quality\\n• Coach other team members to help them grow and bring out their best work\\n• Plan the team’s work and estimate future desired work\\n• Act as Scrum Master of the Agile team\\n• Release and On-call duties -- Participate in release deployment activities and a rotating on-call escalation system during non-business hours.\\n\\nRequired Education And Experience\\n• 5+ years work experience as a software developer\\n• Experience supervising the work of technical staff either formally or informally\\n• 2+ years experience with Angular\\n• 2+ years experience with C#\\n• Bachelor degree in Computer Science, MIS, or equivalent technology discipline\\n\\nDesired Knowledge, Skills, And Abilities\\n• Relational databases\\n• DevOps workflows related to cloud-based development and deployment\\n• Experience in an Agile software development environment\\n• Demonstrated technical leadership\\n• Clear communication skills to various types of audiences\\n• History of continuous improvement\\n\\nCompensation at Pearson is influenced by a wide array of factors including but not limited to skill set, level of experience, and specific location. As required by the Colorado, California, Washington State, New York State and New York City laws, the pay range for this position is as follows:\\n\\nThe minimum full-time salary range is between $120k- 135k.\\n\\nThis position is eligible to participate in an annual incentive program, and information on benefits offered is here.\\n\\nWhat To Expect From Pearson\\n\\nDid you know Pearson is one of the 10 most innovative education companies of 2022?\\n\\nAt Pearson, we add life to a lifetime of learning so everyone can realize the life they imagine.

During this initial build-out period which we anticipate will last 1 year, you’ll direct the work of the 3-person USA-based team of developers, QA consultants in India, and additional temporary Dev and QA consultants. Roughly 2/3rds of your time will be writing code as an individual contributor and the other 1/3rd of your time will be on leadership and supervision tasks. You will supervise all engineering activities of the team, including technical decision-making, creating team processes, and leading code review. You will provide work direction as part of Agile software development processes and serve as the team’s Scrum Master. Though you will supervise the work of other engineers on the team, this is an individual contributor role and HR management responsibilities of other engineers would be with someone else.\\n\\nAfter this initial build-out period is complete, your role shifts to be 100% individual contributor at a Senior level and your focus areas will expand beyond just Item Assist. You’ll continue to provide technical leadership to the team but covering all of ExamDeveloper, not just the Item Assist features. You’ll be part of a larger team at this stage.\\n\\nThe Tool\\n\\nOur Item Assist tool started off as a standalone prototype tool for letting users use generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) to create test questions. Building upon the success of the prototype we are incorporating these AI interactions into Pearson VUE’s ExamDeveloper item authoring tool (https://www.pearsonvue.com/us/en/test-owners/develop.html). ExamDeveloper is a web-based exam development platform that allows our customers to write, review and manage questions on their exams. ExamDeveloper is the leading web-based tool for creating tests to certify test-takers in the professional skills they require. Customers rely on ExamDeveloper to support their entire workflow around question writing, collaborative review, scoring, and test management.\\n\\nSpecial note: this role and this specific team will not be doing AI-based development work. Other engineering teams at Pearson are working on the AI capabilities that power the Item Assist product. The Item Assist features in ExamDeveloper represent the user interface and the application experience for our customers. Therefore, skills like machine learning, prompting, large language models, etc are not applicable to this role, but some knowledge about AI concepts could be beneficial.\\n\\nIn this role you’ll focus on the new Item Assist features in ExamDeveloper but will also work on other ExamDeveloper development efforts. You will partner with the Product Manager to bring their vision to reality and work alongside the Architect, Project Manager, and Business Analyst.\\n\\nExamDeveloper’s primary tech stack is .NET and C# on the backend and Angular on the frontend hosted in Microsoft Azure. Item Assist will use an in-house Angular-based UI framework. You’ll work with containerized services orchestrated by Kubernetes and Microsoft SQL Server. We strongly prefer Angular experience because it is an important technology for this product.\\n\\nWork Location:\\n\\nREMOTE - United States , required to work mostly Central time zone normal business hours.\\n\\nResponsibilities\\n• Develop new features and other technical implementation work (see notes above for allocations for this that vary over time)\\n• Make technical decisions on behalf of the team with partnership of the Architect\\n• Provide leadership for the team of engineers in an Agile software development approach\\n• Create work processes for the team and continually evolve them as needs change\\n• Enforce high standards of software development to achieve quality\\n• Coach other team members to help them grow and bring out their best work\\n• Plan the team’s work and estimate future desired work\\n• Act as Scrum Master of the Agile team\\n• Release and On-call duties -- Participate in release deployment activities and a rotating on-call escalation system during non-business hours.\\n\\nRequired Education And Experience\\n• 5+ years work experience as a software developer\\n• Experience supervising the work of technical staff either formally or informally\\n• 2+ years experience with Angular\\n• 2+ years experience with C#\\n• Bachelor degree in Computer Science, MIS, or equivalent technology discipline\\n\\nDesired Knowledge, Skills, And Abilities\\n• Relational databases\\n• DevOps workflows related to cloud-based development and deployment\\n• Experience in an Agile software development environment\\n• Demonstrated technical leadership\\n• Clear communication skills to various types of audiences\\n• History of continuous improvement\\n\\nCompensation at Pearson is influenced by a wide array of factors including but not limited to skill set, level of experience, and specific location.

By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more.\\n\\nThe Role\\n\\nPalantir's defense product vertical builds mission-critical products for the modern warfighter. We provide a complete ecosystem where customers can securely integrate and visualize their data, and build sophisticated, full-fledged programs such as common operating pictures, alert-triaging inboxes, and resource allocation planning tools driven by rich-ML models. Our customers use our defense offering to perform rich analyses that drive core operations within their organizations - these programs are relied upon for daily operations in the command centers and battlefronts of militaries across the world.\\n\\nThis is a frontend engineering role focused on application development for our defense product offering, where you will be responsible for crafting the applications that organizations use every day to keep their countries safe. You will be architecting and developing interfaces to make sophisticated, data-intensive workflows both powerful and approachable, including to non-technical users. You may spend one day talking to users to better understand their needs and identifying product gaps to improve. The next day, you might find yourself putting that customer context to use and brainstorming how to handle intricate UX needs with your teammates. You’ll regularly face sophisticated technical problems, requiring you to scope out the solution design and finding an incremental path to shipping the new features. As part of this, you will own APIs and schemas that power your frontend code, and work with backend engineers in developing them together. You’ll be constantly exploring new horizons and building new skills in service of real world needs: between type theory, operational transforms, 2D and 3D mapping, UI design systems, high-scale graphics rendering, evidence-based performance optimization, and the never-ending need to decompose user asks into rich, sophisticated, and maintainable software, there is always a new challenge to be faced.\\n\\nCore Responsibilities\\n\\nAs a frontend engineer working on our defense product offering, you will be involved throughout the product lifecycle - from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution and shipping.\\n\\nSome examples of product work you could work on are:\\n• Build for high-scale, collaborative, geospatial workflows (Gaia)\\n• Design sophisticated frameworks to enable complex workflows across applications in a single workspace\\n• Develop the next generation of real-time collaborative tooling and data-analysis solutions (Secure Collaboration)\\n\\nTechnologies We Use\\n• Typescript and React are central to our frontend development.\\n• Blueprint as a re-usable frontend component library.\\n• A combination of open-source and internal technologies that suit the problems at hand.\\n• Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, GitHub, and CircleCI.\\n\\nWhat We Value\\n• Passion for building user interfaces that enable users to tackle their problems.\\n• Ability to work optimally in teams of technical and non-technical individuals, e.g. brainstorming and iterating with product designers\\n• Skill and comfort working in a constantly evolving environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users.\\n• Experience building high-quality software in a fast-paced CI/CD development environment\\n• Proven ability to learn continuously, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision.\\n• Ability to learn new technology and concepts, even without in-depth experience. Motivated by unlocking or improving user workflows while still maintaining engineering quality.\\n\\nWhat We Require\\n• 2+ years of frontend software engineering experience.\\n• Strong frontend coding skills. Regardless of which frameworks you use or how you learned them, we’re looking for people who can write clean, effective code. You should already have proficiency in JavaScript and an understanding of how web technologies work.\\n• Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or related field, or equivalent understanding of algorithms, performance, and systems design.\\n• Strong written and verbal communication skills.\\n• Eligibility and willingness to obtain a US Security clearance.\\n\\nSalary\\n\\nThe estimated salary range for this position is estimated to be $135,000 - $200,000/year.

During this initial build-out period which we anticipate will last 1 year, you’ll direct the work of the 3-person USA-based team of developers, QA consultants in India, and additional temporary Dev and QA consultants. Roughly 2/3rds of your time will be writing code as an individual contributor and the other 1/3rd of your time will be on leadership and supervision tasks. You will supervise all engineering activities of the team, including technical decision-making, creating team processes, and leading code review. You will provide work direction as part of Agile software development processes and serve as the team’s Scrum Master. Though you will supervise the work of other engineers on the team, this is an individual contributor role and HR management responsibilities of other engineers would be with someone else.\\n\\nAfter this initial build-out period is complete, your role shifts to be 100% individual contributor at a Senior level and your focus areas will expand beyond just Item Assist. You’ll continue to provide technical leadership to the team but covering all of ExamDeveloper, not just the Item Assist features. You’ll be part of a larger team at this stage.\\n\\nThe Tool\\n\\nOur Item Assist tool started off as a standalone prototype tool for letting users use generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) to create test questions. Building upon the success of the prototype we are incorporating these AI interactions into Pearson VUE’s ExamDeveloper item authoring tool (https://www.pearsonvue.com/us/en/test-owners/develop.html). ExamDeveloper is a web-based exam development platform that allows our customers to write, review and manage questions on their exams. ExamDeveloper is the leading web-based tool for creating tests to certify test-takers in the professional skills they require. Customers rely on ExamDeveloper to support their entire workflow around question writing, collaborative review, scoring, and test management.\\n\\nSpecial note: this role and this specific team will not be doing AI-based development work. Other engineering teams at Pearson are working on the AI capabilities that power the Item Assist product. The Item Assist features in ExamDeveloper represent the user interface and the application experience for our customers. Therefore, skills like machine learning, prompting, large language models, etc are not applicable to this role, but some knowledge about AI concepts could be beneficial.\\n\\nIn this role you’ll focus on the new Item Assist features in ExamDeveloper but will also work on other ExamDeveloper development efforts. You will partner with the Product Manager to bring their vision to reality and work alongside the Architect, Project Manager, and Business Analyst.\\n\\nExamDeveloper’s primary tech stack is .NET and C# on the backend and Angular on the frontend hosted in Microsoft Azure. Item Assist will use an in-house Angular-based UI framework. You’ll work with containerized services orchestrated by Kubernetes and Microsoft SQL Server. We strongly prefer Angular experience because it is an important technology for this product.\\n\\nWork Location:\\n\\nREMOTE - United States , required to work mostly Central time zone normal business hours.\\n\\nResponsibilities\\n• Develop new features and other technical implementation work (see notes above for allocations for this that vary over time)\\n• Make technical decisions on behalf of the team with partnership of the Architect\\n• Provide leadership for the team of engineers in an Agile software development approach\\n• Create work processes for the team and continually evolve them as needs change\\n• Enforce high standards of software development to achieve quality\\n• Coach other team members to help them grow and bring out their best work\\n• Plan the team’s work and estimate future desired work\\n• Act as Scrum Master of the Agile team\\n• Release and On-call duties -- Participate in release deployment activities and a rotating on-call escalation system during non-business hours.\\n\\nRequired Education And Experience\\n• 5+ years work experience as a software developer\\n• Experience supervising the work of technical staff either formally or informally\\n• 2+ years experience with Angular\\n• 2+ years experience with C#\\n• Bachelor degree in Computer Science, MIS, or equivalent technology discipline\\n\\nDesired Knowledge, Skills, And Abilities\\n• Relational databases\\n• DevOps workflows related to cloud-based development and deployment\\n• Experience in an Agile software development environment\\n• Demonstrated technical leadership\\n• Clear communication skills to various types of audiences\\n• History of continuous improvement\\n\\nCompensation at Pearson is influenced by a wide array of factors including but not limited to skill set, level of experience, and specific location.

During this initial build-out period which we anticipate will last 1 year, you’ll direct the work of the 3-person USA-based team of developers, QA consultants in India, and additional temporary Dev and QA consultants. Roughly 2/3rds of your time will be writing code as an individual contributor and the other 1/3rd of your time will be on leadership and supervision tasks. You will supervise all engineering activities of the team, including technical decision-making, creating team processes, and leading code review. You will provide work direction as part of Agile software development processes and serve as the team’s Scrum Master. Though you will supervise the work of other engineers on the team, this is an individual contributor role and HR management responsibilities of other engineers would be with someone else.\\n\\nAfter this initial build-out period is complete, your role shifts to be 100% individual contributor at a Senior level and your focus areas will expand beyond just Item Assist. You’ll continue to provide technical leadership to the team but covering all of ExamDeveloper, not just the Item Assist features. You’ll be part of a larger team at this stage.\\n\\nThe Tool\\n\\nOur Item Assist tool started off as a standalone prototype tool for letting users use generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) to create test questions. Building upon the success of the prototype we are incorporating these AI interactions into Pearson VUE’s ExamDeveloper item authoring tool (https://www.pearsonvue.com/us/en/test-owners/develop.html). ExamDeveloper is a web-based exam development platform that allows our customers to write, review and manage questions on their exams. ExamDeveloper is the leading web-based tool for creating tests to certify test-takers in the professional skills they require. Customers rely on ExamDeveloper to support their entire workflow around question writing, collaborative review, scoring, and test management.\\n\\nSpecial note: this role and this specific team will not be doing AI-based development work. Other engineering teams at Pearson are working on the AI capabilities that power the Item Assist product. The Item Assist features in ExamDeveloper represent the user interface and the application experience for our customers. Therefore, skills like machine learning, prompting, large language models, etc are not applicable to this role, but some knowledge about AI concepts could be beneficial.\\n\\nIn this role you’ll focus on the new Item Assist features in ExamDeveloper but will also work on other ExamDeveloper development efforts. You will partner with the Product Manager to bring their vision to reality and work alongside the Architect, Project Manager, and Business Analyst.\\n\\nExamDeveloper’s primary tech stack is .NET and C# on the backend and Angular on the frontend hosted in Microsoft Azure. Item Assist will use an in-house Angular-based UI framework. You’ll work with containerized services orchestrated by Kubernetes and Microsoft SQL Server. We strongly prefer Angular experience because it is an important technology for this product.\\n\\nWork Location:\\n\\nREMOTE - United States , required to work mostly Central time zone normal business hours.\\n\\nResponsibilities\\n• Develop new features and other technical implementation work (see notes above for allocations for this that vary over time)\\n• Make technical decisions on behalf of the team with partnership of the Architect\\n• Provide leadership for the team of engineers in an Agile software development approach\\n• Create work processes for the team and continually evolve them as needs change\\n• Enforce high standards of software development to achieve quality\\n• Coach other team members to help them grow and bring out their best work\\n• Plan the team’s work and estimate future desired work\\n• Act as Scrum Master of the Agile team\\n• Release and On-call duties -- Participate in release deployment activities and a rotating on-call escalation system during non-business hours.\\n\\nRequired Education And Experience\\n• 5+ years work experience as a software developer\\n• Experience supervising the work of technical staff either formally or informally\\n• 2+ years experience with Angular\\n• 2+ years experience with C#\\n• Bachelor degree in Computer Science, MIS, or equivalent technology discipline\\n\\nDesired Knowledge, Skills, And Abilities\\n• Relational databases\\n• DevOps workflows related to cloud-based development and deployment\\n• Experience in an Agile software development environment\\n• Demonstrated technical leadership\\n• Clear communication skills to various types of audiences\\n• History of continuous improvement\\n\\nCompensation at Pearson is influenced by a wide array of factors including but not limited to skill set, level of experience, and specific location. As required by the Colorado, California, Washington State, New York State and New York City laws, the pay range for this position is as follows:\\n\\nThe minimum full-time salary range is between $120k- 135k.\\n\\nThis position is eligible to participate in an annual incentive program, and information on benefits offered is here.\\n\\nWhat To Expect From Pearson\\n\\nDid you know Pearson is one of the 10 most innovative education companies of 2022?\\n\\nAt Pearson, we add life to a lifetime of learning so everyone can realize the life they imagine. We do this by creating vibrant and enriching learning experiences designed for real-life impact.
