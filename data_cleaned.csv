Senior Software Developer- Item Assist product,,Not Available,False,Not Available,None UT US,"Summary

As a Senior Software Developer, you will be the most senior engineer of a 3-person dev team focused on adding new “Item Assist” features using C# and Angular into the ExamDeveloper web app. This role is expected to evolve in two parts. During this initial build-out period which we anticipate will last 1 year, you’ll direct the work of the 3-person USA-based team of developers, QA consultants in India, and additional temporary Dev and QA consultants. Roughly 2/3rds of your time will be writing code as an individual contributor and the other 1/3rd of your time will be on leadership and supervision tasks. You will supervise all engineering activities of the team, including technical decision-making, creating team processes, and leading code review. You will provide work direction as part of Agile software development processes and serve as the team’s Scrum Master. Though you will supervise the work of other engineers on the team, this is an individual contributor role and HR management responsibilities of other engineers would be with someone else.

After this initial build-out period is complete, your role shifts to be 100% individual contributor at a Senior level and your focus areas will expand beyond just Item Assist. You’ll continue to provide technical leadership to the team but covering all of ExamDeveloper, not just the Item Assist features. You’ll be part of a larger team at this stage.

The Tool

Our Item Assist tool started off as a standalone prototype tool for letting users use generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) to create test questions. Building upon the success of the prototype we are incorporating these AI interactions into Pearson VUE’s ExamDeveloper item authoring tool (https://www.pearsonvue.com/us/en/test-owners/develop.html). ExamDeveloper is a web-based exam development platform that allows our customers to write, review and manage questions on their exams. ExamDeveloper is the leading web-based tool for creating tests to certify test-takers in the professional skills they require. Customers rely on ExamDeveloper to support their entire workflow around question writing, collaborative review, scoring, and test management.

Special note: this role and this specific team will not be doing AI-based development work. Other engineering teams at Pearson are working on the AI capabilities that power the Item Assist product. The Item Assist features in ExamDeveloper represent the user interface and the application experience for our customers. Therefore, skills like machine learning, prompting, large language models, etc are not applicable to this role, but some knowledge about AI concepts could be beneficial.

In this role you’ll focus on the new Item Assist features in ExamDeveloper but will also work on other ExamDeveloper development efforts. You will partner with the Product Manager to bring their vision to reality and work alongside the Architect, Project Manager, and Business Analyst.

ExamDeveloper’s primary tech stack is .NET and C# on the backend and Angular on the frontend hosted in Microsoft Azure. Item Assist will use an in-house Angular-based UI framework. You’ll work with containerized services orchestrated by Kubernetes and Microsoft SQL Server. We strongly prefer Angular experience because it is an important technology for this product.

But it's a war we firmly believe in.
But our apps today are embarrassing and shows our lack of focus on mobile... We're ready for a change. It's been hard to service so many clients at our pace of growth and put the focus on mobile that we wish we would have done a decade ago. With our organization structure, size, and resources we have today, we're ready, even if it's a decade late.
If you're up for a challenge, working with fun good humans, and into doing good work. We'd love to talk

Responsibilities:
• Develop exciting new mobile applications for iOS from the ground up

Why you might like this job:
You hope the metaverse doesn't come... but if it does, we'll at least have caught up to the best mobile app experience we could have had before we all scratch our heads and wonder what on earth we're supposed to make now to stay relevant.
On a more serious note though. We're into open source and privacy. Fighting invasive massive corporations following and tracking users should be a passion borderline problem you deal with anxiety over. We as a company have no affiliates, never sold one ounce of data and go to great lengths to not leak it out the side door via third party tools. If you're passionate about protecting users as the world gets less and less private even though they do dumb stuff like give a cookie pop up on a screen that doesn't do anything or tell us they're ditching cookies and it's for privacy even though it's just a play to not let meta data get into other big evil corporations hands... If this stuff resonates with you. You'll find a similarly minded folks here at Two Barrels and we'll have fun making tech that helps people keep their privacy.

Senior Software Developer- Item Assist product,,Not Available,False,Not Available,None DE US,"Summary

As a Senior Software Developer, you will be the most senior engineer of a 3-person dev team focused on adding new “Item Assist” features using C# and Angular into the ExamDeveloper web app. This role is expected to evolve in two parts. During this initial build-out period which we anticipate will last 1 year, you’ll direct the work of the 3-person USA-based team of developers, QA consultants in India, and additional temporary Dev and QA consultants. Roughly 2/3rds of your time will be writing code as an individual contributor and the other 1/3rd of your time will be on leadership and supervision tasks. You will supervise all engineering activities of the team, including technical decision-making, creating team processes, and leading code review. You will provide work direction as part of Agile software development processes and serve as the team’s Scrum Master. Though you will supervise the work of other engineers on the team, this is an individual contributor role and HR management responsibilities of other engineers would be with someone else.

After this initial build-out period is complete, your role shifts to be 100% individual contributor at a Senior level and your focus areas will expand beyond just Item Assist. You’ll continue to provide technical leadership to the team but covering all of ExamDeveloper, not just the Item Assist features. You’ll be part of a larger team at this stage.

The Tool

Our Item Assist tool started off as a standalone prototype tool for letting users use generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) to create test questions. Building upon the success of the prototype we are incorporating these AI interactions into Pearson VUE’s ExamDeveloper item authoring tool (https://www.pearsonvue.com/us/en/test-owners/develop.html). ExamDeveloper is a web-based exam development platform that allows our customers to write, review and manage questions on their exams. ExamDeveloper is the leading web-based tool for creating tests to certify test-takers in the professional skills they require. Customers rely on ExamDeveloper to support their entire workflow around question writing, collaborative review, scoring, and test management.

Special note: this role and this specific team will not be doing AI-based development work. Other engineering teams at Pearson are working on the AI capabilities that power the Item Assist product. The Item Assist features in ExamDeveloper represent the user interface and the application experience for our customers. Therefore, skills like machine learning, prompting, large language models, etc are not applicable to this role, but some knowledge about AI concepts could be beneficial.

In this role you’ll focus on the new Item Assist features in ExamDeveloper but will also work on other ExamDeveloper development efforts. You will partner with the Product Manager to bring their vision to reality and work alongside the Architect, Project Manager, and Business Analyst.

ExamDeveloper’s primary tech stack is .NET and C# on the backend and Angular on the frontend hosted in Microsoft Azure. Item Assist will use an in-house Angular-based UI framework. You’ll work with containerized services orchestrated by Kubernetes and Microsoft SQL Server. We strongly prefer Angular experience because it is an important technology for this product.

• Plan the team’s work and estimate future desired work
• Act as Scrum Master of the Agile team

Though you will supervise the work of other engineers on the team, this is an individual contributor role and HR management responsibilities of other engineers would be with someone else.

After this initial build-out period is complete, your role shifts to be 100% individual contributor at a Senior level and your focus areas will expand beyond just Item Assist. You’ll continue to provide technical leadership to the team but covering all of ExamDeveloper, not just the Item Assist features. You’ll be part of a larger team at this stage.

The Tool

Our Item Assist tool started off as a standalone prototype tool for letting users use generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) to create test questions. Building upon the success of the prototype we are incorporating these AI interactions into Pearson VUE’s ExamDeveloper item authoring tool (https://www.pearsonvue.com/us/en/test-owners/develop.html). ExamDeveloper is a web-based exam development platform that allows our customers to write, review and manage questions on their exams. ExamDeveloper is the leading web-based tool for creating tests to certify test-takers in the professional skills they require. Customers rely on ExamDeveloper to support their entire workflow around question writing, collaborative review, scoring, and test management.

Special note: this role and this specific team will not be doing AI-based development work. Other engineering teams at Pearson are working on the AI capabilities that power the Item Assist product. The Item Assist features in ExamDeveloper represent the user interface and the application experience for our customers. Therefore, skills like machine learning, prompting, large language models, etc are not applicable to this role, but some knowledge about AI concepts could be beneficial.

In this role you’ll focus on the new Item Assist features in ExamDeveloper but will also work on other ExamDeveloper development efforts. You will partner with the Product Manager to bring their vision to reality and work alongside the Architect, Project Manager, and Business Analyst.

ExamDeveloper’s primary tech stack is .NET and C# on the backend and Angular on the frontend hosted in Microsoft Azure. Item Assist will use an in-house Angular-based UI framework. You’ll work with containerized services orchestrated by Kubernetes and Microsoft SQL Server. We strongly prefer Angular experience because it is an important technology for this product.

Weekly Hours: 5
Role Number:200571342

Here in Worldwide Developer Relations, we work tirelessly to ensure that developers have all of the support they need to create the apps that impact the lives of all our customers. Join Apple, and help us leave the world better than we found it.

There are countless ways you’ll contribute here, whether you’re coordinating operational needs for feature launches, defining processes and policies, or identifying opportunities to improve the developer experience. If you are interested in driving a dynamic and growing team enabling Apple developers to operate successfully around the world, this role may be for you!

Description

Description
We’re looking for a stellar candidate to support the tool, policies, and operations involved in servicing developer requests for access to managed capabilities, including entitlements and feature access. In this role, you will ensure that a team of specialists tasked with reviewing those requests have the tools and resources needed to be successful.

You will be tasked with interpreting loosely defined proposals from engineering and product teams, and determine a path to ensuring objectivity, consistency, and efficiency when reviewing developer requests for enablement. This will require collaboration with legal and business leaders, and require you to be the “voice of the developer”. You must be comfortable challenging proposals when they are not feasible or scalable.

You will be responsible for the tools and processes that ensure support specialists are able to meet their objectives and provide efficient, accurate, and consistent experiences for developers. This will require working closely with engineering and business teams, and will continuously present opportunities to identify improvements to better align processes and tools.

You will also be responsible for developing metrics to assess the team’s performance in meeting objectives — such as handle times, developer satisfaction, decision dispute rates, and process accuracy — and recommending strategies to constantly improve and scale operations. You will be responsible for managing your work stream via weekly status reports, risks and dependency management, and business planning.

This role is technical, exceptionally hands on, and will require you to be an expert in the details. A normal day will involve everything from meeting with engineering teams to review proposals for new capabilities, to configuring developer-facing request forms, to writing requirements for tools enhancements, to following up with inbound requests for status or decision support from developers. Bringing your creativity and rolling up your sleeves is a must!

iOS App Developer,,Not Available,False,Not Available,None TX US,"Overview:
Two Barrels is hiring a iOS App Developer for $120,000/year. You will be a traditional company employee. This is a full time 40 hour/week position with company benefits. This is a remote position or you could work onsite if you wanted. Our main office is in Spokane WA, and we have satellite offices in Austin TX and Salt Lake City UT. At this time we are only able to support employees that are US residents. Sorry!
Are you really into mobile development? We'd like to be able to say we truly are into mobile development and have put the proper resources into building a vibrant mobile group of developers. As of today, we're no where close to where we'd like to be and we're looking for inspired folks to help us play in mobile as well as possible. Might that be you?
We run a number of business tool apps that help people at all stages of their business with various services and tools. From domains, phones, emails, business entity maintenance, business licenses, mail received on their behalf, etc. It's complex and we service millions of users.
The largest problem you'll be trying to solve is running our Phone App. We run a second phone line app mostly for businesses but we fancy ourselves as the most private, encrypted way to send messages and do phone calls that exists. Think Whats App and Google Voice, but without it being free so the big evil corporations can get your meta data. Running a second phone line and keeping our users communications as private as possible on hardware that is meant to not provide any privacy to the user on infrastructure and telecommunications that are meant to not provide any privacy to the users is our largest challenge. But it's a war we firmly believe in.
But our apps today are embarrassing and shows our lack of focus on mobile... We're ready for a change. It's been hard to service so many clients at our pace of growth and put the focus on mobile that we wish we would have done a decade ago. With our organization structure, size, and resources we have today, we're ready, even if it's a decade late.
If you're up for a challenge, working with fun good humans, and into doing good work. We'd love to talk

Minimum Qualifications:

Preferred Qualifications:

• Able to work in an agile environment with a focus on continuous integration

Why you might like this job:
You hope the metaverse doesn't come... but if it does, we'll at least have caught up to the best mobile app experience we could have had before we all scratch our heads and wonder what on earth we're supposed to make now to stay relevant.
On a more serious note though. We're into open source and privacy. Fighting invasive massive corporations following and tracking users should be a passion borderline problem you deal with anxiety over. We as a company have no affiliates, never sold one ounce of data and go to great lengths to not leak it out the side door via third party tools. If you're passionate about protecting users as the world gets less and less private even though they do dumb stuff like give a cookie pop up on a screen that doesn't do anything or tell us they're ditching cookies and it's for privacy even though it's just a play to not let meta data get into other big evil corporations hands... If this stuff resonates with you. You'll find a similarly minded folks here at Two Barrels and we'll have fun making tech that helps people keep their privacy.
